Truss handles the painful parts of services, freeing you to focus on the
business logic.

## Install

Currently, there is no binary distribution of Truss, you must install from
source.

To install this software, you must:

1. Install protoc 3 or newer. The easiest way is to
download a release from [github](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases)
and add to `$PATH`.
Otherwise [install from source.](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
1. Install Truss with

	```
	go get -u -d github.com/shore-cheng/truss
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/shore-cheng/truss
	make dependencies
	make
	```
	On Windows, do the following instead:
	```
	go get -u -d github.com/shore-cheng/truss
	cd %GOPATH%/src/github.com/shore-cheng/truss
	wininstall.bat
	```

## Usage

Using Truss is easy. You define your service with [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)
and [protoc buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3),
and Truss uses that definition to create an entire service. You can even
add [http annotations](
https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/928a151b2f871b4239b7707e1bb59258df3fe10a/google/api/http.proto#L36)
for HTTP 1.1/JSON transport!

Then you open the `handlers/handlers.go`,
add you business logic, and you're good to go.

Here is an example service definition: [Echo Service](./_example/echo.proto)

Try Truss for yourself on Echo Service to see the service that is generated:

```
truss _example/echo.proto
```

See [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) and [TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md) for more details.
